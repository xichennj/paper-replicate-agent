# CLAUDE.MD -- UKB Empirical Replication Agent

**Project:** UKB Empirical Replication Agent
**Institution:** China Agricultural University
**Branch:** main

---

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- run scripts and confirm outputs match targets at the end of every task
- **Replicate before extending** -- match published results exactly before any modifications
- **Quality gates** -- nothing ships below 80/100
- **[LEARN] tags** -- when corrected, save `[LEARN:category] wrong → right` to MEMORY.md
