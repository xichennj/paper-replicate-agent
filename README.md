# UKB Empirical Replication Agent

A structured Claude Code workflow for **empirically replicating published research**. Special thanks to Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna for the claude-code-my-workflow repository, which inspired this workflow. You describe a paper; Claude plans the replication approach, writes R/Python scripts, validates outputs against published targets, documents discrepancies, and reports results — like a research contractor who handles the full pipeline.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Set Up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/paper-replicate-agent-demo.git
cd paper-replicate-agent-demo
```

### 2. Start Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### 3. Describe Your Task

Paste a prompt like:

> I want to replicate [Paper Author (Year)]. The PDF is in `papers/[PaperName]/`. The relevant UKB data is in `data/`. Please enter plan mode, read the paper, identify all empirical targets, and plan the replication.

**What this does:** Claude reads the configuration files and paper, inventories the available data, identifies every table and figure to replicate, enters plan mode, drafts a step-by-step plan, waits for your approval, then implements — running scripts, verifying outputs against tolerance thresholds, and saving a validation report.

---

## How It Works

### Contractor Mode

You describe a task. For complex or ambiguous requests, Claude first creates a requirements specification with MUST/SHOULD/MAY priorities. You approve the spec, then Claude plans, implements, verifies, scores against quality gates, and presents a summary. Say "just do it" and it auto-commits when the work meets quality standards.

### Replication Pipeline (6 Phases)

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **0. Paper Intake** | Read paper; record all empirical targets in `quality_reports/[paper]_replication_targets.md` |
| **1. Inventory & Data Audit** | Verify data matches paper's described sample (N, events, key variables) |
| **2. Translate & Execute** | Write R/Python scripts; match original specification exactly |
| **3. Verify Match** | Check outputs against targets within tolerance thresholds |
| **4. Document Discrepancies** | Investigate every near-miss; document explanations |
| **5. Report** | Save `replications/[paper]/validation_report.md` and polished `reports/[paper]_replication_report.md` |

### Specialized Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `domain-reviewer` | Senior epidemiology referee (NEJM/Lancet/IJE standard) — checks causal assumptions, methods, code-theory alignment |
| `r-reviewer` | R code quality, reproducibility, and UKB-specific correctness |
| `proofreader` | Grammar, typos, consistency in reports |
| `verifier` | End-to-end task completion verification |

### Quality Gates

Every script and report gets a score (0–100). Scores below threshold block the action:
- **80** — commit threshold
- **90** — PR threshold
- **95** — excellence (aspirational)

### Tolerance Thresholds

| Quantity | Tolerance |
|----------|-----------|
| Sample sizes (N, events) | Exact match |
| Point estimates (HR, OR, β) | ±0.01 |
| Standard errors | ±0.05 |
| P-values | Same significance bracket |
| Percentages | ±0.1pp |

**Path-scoped** (load only when working on matching files):

| Rule | Triggers On | What It Enforces |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| `replication-protocol` | `replications/**`, `scripts/**` | 6-phase replication + Stata→R/Python pitfalls |
| `quality-gates` | `*.R`, `*.py`, `reports/**` | 80/90/95 scoring + tolerance thresholds |

## Data Setup

Create a `data/` directory at the project root and place approved datasets there.

The `data/` folder is intentionally excluded from version control.

1. Place your UKB data extract in `data/` (gitignored — never commit)
2. Apply the latest participant withdrawal list before any analysis
3. Update your UKB Application ID in `CLAUDE.md`
4. Verify field IDs against the [UKB Data Showcase](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/)
